# Sea-Level-Predictor
This project analyzes a dataset of global average sea level change since 1880. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy, you'll visualize historical sea level trends and predict change through year 2050.
##### The notebook performs the following tasks:

- Imports the dataset of sea level measurements since 1880.
- Creates a scatter plot of sea level over time.
- Fits a line of best fit using all available data, then extends it to predict sea level in 2050.
- Fits another line using only data from 2000 onward, extending it to predict sea level in 2050 if recent trends continue.

This allows you to compare long-term trends with more recent changes, providing insight into future sea level rise scenarios.
